						<p class="bio">
						Brandon Lee O'Briant is a modern day 'Renaissance Man' and aspiring DATA SCIENTIST who thrives in solving complex problems with a creative expertise.
						After graduating from Pacific Lutheran University with a B.S. Mathematics in December 2016, he is a currently pursing an M.S. Data Science degree at Northwestern University's School of Professional Studies MSDS program (extension of the M.S. in Predictive Analytics program). he is a technically sophisticated analyst with recent academic background in predictive analytics, 3+ years of experience in SQL, R, Python, C++, and logical data modeling, and solid skills in programming and strategic planning. 
						Brandon brings broad knowledge of statistics, mathematics, computer systems, and programming languages. In previous and current roles and research projects, he has developed solid skills to provide reports, analyze data, manage records, and coordinate with a variety of teams and stakeholders. 
						Additionally, he possesses extensive experience in design thinking from inception to presentation. Committed to the highest quality and research accuracy, he builds productive relationships with all stakeholders and organize timelines and methodologies to achieve common goals. 
						Brandons's interest include, but not limited to: AI, data science, deep learning, health analytics, machine learning, computational modeling/simulation, data engineering, and high performance computing (Tensorflow and CUDA).

			<h4>About Northwestern University's MSDS Program</h4>
			<p>
			This is the second phase of Brandon's journey into the world of data science and analytics, with the first being his endeavour into mathematics via Pacific Lutheran University's B.S. in Mathematics program.<br><br> Northwestern University's M.S. Data Science Program (MSDS) has provided Brandon the opportunity to hone critical skills for succeeding in today's data-intensive world. With real-world specific projects Brandon utilizes relational and document database systems and analytics software built upon open-source systems such as R, Python, and TensorFlow to develop trustworthy predictions using traditional statistics and machine learning methods.<br><br> Brandon is working towards the analytics and modeling specialization, which draws on courses such as regression and multivariate analysis, generalized linear models, time series analysis and forecasting, practical machine learning, and advanced modeling techniques. Having fallen in love with investment science, probability and statistical theory, computational science and modeling, and mathemtics of risk in his undergradute work, Brandon is pursuing elective courses in financial and risk analytics.<br><br>

			The program is attended online, which provides a rich, remote, and comprehesnive experience through discussion boards, invidual and team projects, and time management under the advisment of
			MSDS faculty members, which include data scientists, professional researchers and consultants, social scientists, mathematicians, statisticians, and computer scientists.
