			<h4>About Northwestern University's MSDS Program</h4>
			<p>
			This is the second phase of Brandon's journey into the world of data science and analytics, with the first endeavor being mathematics while attending Pacific Lutheran University's B.S. in Mathematics program.<br><br> Northwestern University's M.S. Data Science Program (MSDS) has provided him with the opportunity to hone critical skills for succeeding in today's data-intensive world. With real-world specific projects, he utilizes relational database systems and analytics software built upon open-source systems such as R, Python, and TensorFlow to develop trustworthy predictions using traditional statistics and machine learning methods.<br><br> Brandon is working towards the analytics and modeling specialization, which draws on courses such as regression and multivariate analysis, generalized linear models, time series analysis and forecasting, practical machine learning, and advanced modeling techniques. Having developed a deep interest in investment science, probability and statistical theory, computational science and modeling, and mathematics of risk in his undergraduate work, Brandon is pursuing elective courses in financial and risk analytics.<br><br>
			The program is attended online, which provides a rich, remote, and comprehensive experience through discussion boards, individual and team projects, and time management under the advisement of MSDS faculty members, which include data scientists, professional researchers and consultants, social scientists, mathematicians, statisticians, and computer scientists.

			With new tech companies emerging everyday, which four companies should I build my Tech Portfolio with? Given those four choosen, how can I optimize this portfolio to maximize returns, while minimizing total cost? Useing Python I created an optimized portfolio of tech securities Apple Inc (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT),
